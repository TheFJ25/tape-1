# tape 1

Scene 1:
The tape starts with Mario appearing in the castle, and walking into the courtyard, but instead of seeing the "L is real 2401" statue, he sees a pipe. Plus, he dosen't see any boos, and it's nighttime. After thinking for a bit, Mario decides to go down the pipe, which is what he does.
